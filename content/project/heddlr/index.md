[R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) is one of the coolest
parts of the R ecosystem, making it trivial to create professional-looking
HTML and PDF documents using simple markdown language. `heddlr` looks to
extend that functionality by making it easier to dynamically piece
together documents by intelligently using your data to combine defined
components into a cohesive whole, leading to cleaner code and faster
creation of reports that have many repeating pieces or dashboards which
need to respond to changes in their data sources.

You can find more information about this project in the 
[documentation](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/heddlr/), or check out the
