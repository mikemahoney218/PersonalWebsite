I'm thrilled to be speaking at two conferences this fall, both on my work with beaver in the Adirondacks.  
The conferences are:  

**The Rochester Academy of Sciences Fall Paper Session**  
Geneseo, New York  
November 9, 9:30 AM   
Bailey Hall Room 201

**The Forest Ecosystem Monitoring Collaborative Conference**  
Burlington, Vermont  
December 14, 11:30 AM  
Davis Center RTBA

I'll be posting my slides and talk notes here following each conference.
