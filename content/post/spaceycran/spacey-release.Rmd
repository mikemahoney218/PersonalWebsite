I've launched a new package to CRAN! `spacey` helps you pull elevation and 
image overlay data from the USGS and ESRI, then helps you turn them into 
beautiful maps via [the fantastic `rayshader` package](https://www.rayshader.com/).

The package has a [documentation website](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/spacey/)
built with [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) -- check it out for more 
information!
