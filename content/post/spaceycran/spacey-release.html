<p>I’ve launched a new package to CRAN! <code>spacey</code> helps you pull elevation and
image overlay data from the USGS and ESRI, then helps you turn them into
beautiful maps via <a href="https://www.rayshader.com/">the fantastic <code>rayshader</code> package</a>.</p>
<p>The package has a <a href="https://mikemahoney218.github.io/spacey/">documentation website</a>
built with <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a> – check it out for more
information!</p>
