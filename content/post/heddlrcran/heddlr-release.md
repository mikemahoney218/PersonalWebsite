My first package just got published to CRAN today! `heddlr` is a set of
tools that make it easier to write modular R Markdown documents by
decomposing them into a set of patterns which can be repeated and
combined based on your input data, letting you dynamically add and
remove sections based on your data. I started this package to solve an
issue I found myself running into when building
[flexdashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), and have
since found out that there’s all sorts of cool tricks you can do by
applying this type of functional programming mindset to R Markdown
documents.

You can find out more on heddlr’s [documentation
website](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/heddlr/), proudly made in R
via [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). This first version on CRAN is
0.5.0, with 0.1 -&gt; 0.4 previously released on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/heddlr).
