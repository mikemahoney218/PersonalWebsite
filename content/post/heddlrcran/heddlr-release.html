<p>My first package just got published to CRAN today! <code>heddlr</code> is a set of tools
that make it easier to write modular R Markdown documents by decomposing them
into a set of patterns which can be repeated and combined based on your input
data, letting you dynamically add and remove sections based on your data. I
started this package to solve an issue I found myself running into when
building <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboards</a>, and
have since found out that there’s all sorts of cool tricks you can do by
applying this type of functional programming mindset to R Markdown documents.</p>
<p>You can find out more on heddlr’s <a href="https://mikemahoney218.github.io/heddlr/">documentation website</a>,
proudly made in R via <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a>. This first version
on CRAN is 0.5.0, with 0.1 -&gt; 0.4 previously released on <a href="https://github.com/mikemahoney218/heddlr">GitHub</a>.</p>
