<p>I’m in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-art-and-science-of-data-visualization-6f9d706d673e">Towards Data Science</a> today, talking about the theory behind what makes a good visualization and how you can use those concepts to improve your own graphics. The guide is written for all experience levels and doesn’t contain a snippet of code, though – as usual – you can find the R Markdown documents used to build the article on [GitHub].</p>
<p>The TDS article can be found <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-art-and-science-of-data-visualization-6f9d706d673e">at this link</a> – I plan on putting the content on this website, too, once I get the chance.</p>
