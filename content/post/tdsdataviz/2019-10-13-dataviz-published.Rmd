I'm in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-art-and-science-of-data-visualization-6f9d706d673e) today, talking about the theory behind what makes a good visualization and how you can use those concepts to improve your own graphics. The guide is written for all experience levels and doesn't contain a snippet of code, though -- as usual -- you can find the R Markdown documents used to build the article on [GitHub].

The TDS article can be found [at this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-art-and-science-of-data-visualization-6f9d706d673e) -- I plan on putting the content on this website, too, once I get the chance.
