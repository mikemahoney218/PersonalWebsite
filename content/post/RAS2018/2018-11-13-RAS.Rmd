I was happy to attend the Rochester Academy of Sciences Fall Paper Session this past weekend! It seemed like an incredibly diverse array of work was on display - one particularly notable poster connected human heights and weights to the weight of their cremation remains - and the atmosphere was incredibly welcoming.

My talk on beaver impacts seemed to get decent reviews! I've [posted my slides on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/MichaelMahoney83/beaver-foraging-preferences-and-impacts-on-forest-structure-ras), and will be posting a rough script of the talk soon enough. I've got plans for a few changes before the [FEMC conference](https://www.mikemahoney218.com/post/twofallconf2018/2018-10-23-two-fall-conferences/), coming up in a month.
