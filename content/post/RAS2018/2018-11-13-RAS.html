<p>I was happy to attend the Rochester Academy of Sciences Fall Paper Session this past weekend! It seemed like an incredibly diverse array of work was on display - one particularly notable poster connected human heights and weights to the weight of their cremation remains - and the atmosphere was incredibly welcoming.</p>
<p>My talk on beaver impacts seemed to get decent reviews! I’ve <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/MichaelMahoney83/beaver-foraging-preferences-and-impacts-on-forest-structure-ras">posted my slides on SlideShare</a>, and will be posting a rough script of the talk soon enough. I’ve got plans for a few changes before the <a href="https://www.mikemahoney218.com/post/twofallconf2018/2018-10-23-two-fall-conferences/">FEMC conference</a>, coming up in a month.</p>
