I finally got to uploading my [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-art-and-science-of-data-visualization-6f9d706d673e) article as a tutorial (using the cool "courses" function of the Hugo academic theme). I personally like this format better than the Medium article -- you can check it out at [this link](../../../tutorials/dataviz).
