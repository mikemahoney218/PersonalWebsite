<p>I finally got to uploading my <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-art-and-science-of-data-visualization-6f9d706d673e">Towards Data Science</a> article as a tutorial (using the cool “courses” function of the Hugo academic theme). I personally like this format better than the Medium article – you can check it out at <a href="../../../tutorials/dataviz">this link</a>.</p>
