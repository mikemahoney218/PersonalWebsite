      <title>heddlr: Dynamic R Markdown Document Generation</title>
      <link>https://www.mikemahoney218.com/project/heddlr/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R Markdown&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest
parts of the R ecosystem, making it trivial to create professional-looking
HTML and PDF documents using simple markdown language. &lt;code&gt;heddlr&lt;/code&gt; looks to
extend that functionality by making it easier to dynamically piece
together documents by intelligently using your data to combine defined
components into a cohesive whole, leading to cleaner code and faster
creation of reports that have many repeating pieces or dashboards which
need to respond to changes in their data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about this project in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mikemahoney218.github.io/heddlr/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, or check out the
code on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mikemahoney218/heddlr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Data Exploration and Analysis with R</title>
      <link>https://www.mikemahoney218.com/project/idear/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of resources online to learn R. Some of them are extremely well-written and well-structured, but approach things from a different perspective than I find useful. Some of them are expansive and touch on a massive number of topics, but either don’t go as thoroughly into these topics as might be helpful, or have an interesting writing style or are otherwise hard to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a very specific idea of how R should be taught, at least to those interested in using it for data science and other analytical applications. And so in 2018 I began working on a reader - conceived at the time as a series of lecture notes, to support a 3-credit undergrad course - that could be used to learn R that way. However, as I started giving out copies of the reader to friends for feedback, I noticed that a lot of them found the book useful to learn R on their own, and would rather learn that way than in a lecture environment. As such, I started shifting the content into more of a standalone book, attempting to teach R for use in analysis work in both scientific and business contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is currently going through a second round of edits, and may be found in its current state &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/mikemahoney218/IDEAR/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;. If you find the book helpful (or if you&amp;rsquo;ve got suggestions on how it could be improved), please drop me a line - I love hearing from people who have stumbled across it!&lt;/p&gt;
