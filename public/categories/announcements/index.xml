&lt;p&gt;I was happy to attend the Rochester Academy of Sciences Fall Paper Session this past weekend! It seemed like an incredibly diverse array of work was on display - one particularly notable poster connected human heights and weights to the weight of their cremation remains - and the atmosphere was incredibly welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk on beaver impacts seemed to get decent reviews! I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/MichaelMahoney83/beaver-foraging-preferences-and-impacts-on-forest-structure-ras&#34;&gt;posted my slides on SlideShare&lt;/a&gt;, and will be posting a rough script of the talk soon enough. I’ve got plans for a few changes before the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mikemahoney218.com/post/twofallconf2018/2018-10-23-two-fall-conferences/&#34;&gt;FEMC conference&lt;/a&gt;, coming up in a month.&lt;/p&gt;
